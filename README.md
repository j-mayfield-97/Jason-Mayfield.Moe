# Jason-Mayfield.Moe
My portfolio website which is running a Lua web framework (Sailor)

My goal for this site was to minimize the use of other languages. So all the scripting and manipulation will be done with Lua.

I would never describe myself as a web dev , but I'm giving it my best try. There's minimal documentaion for all the tools used and as such it was a bit challenging to get stuff going. But I would be happy to answer any questions I can about the deployment processes.

Hopefully this site will be memorable to someone hiring.
