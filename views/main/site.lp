	This site is very early in development. For now I will explain the tools and the choices I've made
	for this site. To put it simply I dislike <code>Javascript</code>, I had a class project with it once and I
	had a truly miserable time. So my goal on future web development is to use as minimal an amount of <code>JS</code> 
	as possible. I also had an interest in <code>Lua</code>. I've wanted to use it on projects in the past but I
	hadn't gotten the chance. Until I realized that <code>Lua</code> was an option for web development. The 
	<code>Sailor</code> project caught my interest because it was based on <code>Lua</code> and had a very quick learning curve.
	On top of being named after <a href="https://www.viz.com/sailor-moon">Sailor Moon <i style="text-muted"> (something I enjoy immensely)</i></a>
	inspired me. <code>Sailor</code> by default also uses <code>Starlight</code> which parses <code>Lua</code> then precompiles <code>Lua</code> scripts to <code>JS</code>;
	allowing me to just write <code>Lua</code> for the browser. I'm also using <code>Bootstrap</code> as it seemed
	really helpful for front-end. I'd be happy to answer any other questions about the site.
</p>

	<h2>Update:</h2> Though the development of this site has been a fun challenge for me, I would not recommend that
	anyone else develop using these tools. The time to iterate on the scripting in <code>Lua</code> is just way too long.
	I'm also not aware of a way to debug the Lua client-side as it runs the site. If this were not a personal challenge I gave
	myself, there's no way I would have a sustainable development cycle. There's a variety of other tools with more
	documentation to have a website up and running almost immediately. I have definitely learned a lot about Lua and web
	development through this challenge though, so it's already worth it.

<p>The <a href="https://nic.moe/en/">top level domain</a> <code>.moe</code> in Japanese: “萌え”; pronounced as “moh-ay”.
 	<code>Moe</code> is a very versatile word used to express a deep feeling or passion for something you love.

	Gify Page exist becasue I wanted to have some kind of interactive media on the site while I learn to make this 
	site more interactive, which it will be in the future. Also I found that and the theme through a <a href="https://neocities.org/">GeoCities-like</a>.
	I plan to get rid of it after I have other interactivity on the site.
