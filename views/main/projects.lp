    Every single project is a learning experience and I'm always progressing as a dev.

    I plan on making videos to demonstrate my projects in the future when I have more time but for now screen grabs
    will have to do.

                This is the first C++ project I've worked on. A post on Stack Exchange suggested my first game be no more complicated than Pong.
                That seemed like a good first project. It introduced my to many of concepts, and
                Simple Direct Library SDL, which as the name suggest is an easy to understand ,
                set of tools to help put together interactive apps. It manages things like window creation,
                key inputs, and sound. Pretty nifty for beginning game development.

                This project, which is still very much in early development, is meant to be a Deck-Building, Monster-Collecting, Rouge-Lite
                Development on this game has been a bit harder than I initially thought it'd be. There's a saving feature, randomized map and item builders,
                and a turn-based battle system. Also what I want the game to be continues to be more complex. This 
                game also runs with SDL. The code on this project is a lot easier to read and I'm trying to document better.
                I'm also planning future optimizations as I go. There's also a TO-DO list in the project.

                Jason-Mayfield.Moe, this website, is a project in itself. This is my first Lua project and my first web deployment.
                I go into more detail in <a href="/?r=main/site">Web Dev & Tools</a>, but in short this is how I've challenged myself to get 
                more comfortable with Lua. I'm writing only Lua code for front and back end, which is not very standard at all.
                It has been pretty tough to get this far, as I'm learning Html, Css, Lua, web-architecture, and more, 
                all at the same time. I hope the dozens of hours I've put in already come through, as I will continue to develop this site.

        Many more projects to come! I always want to learn and create.
