<h2>Update:</h2> Though the development of this site has been a fun challenge for me, I would not recommend that
anyone else develop using these tools. The time to iterate on the scripting in <code>Lua</code> is just way too long.
I'm also not aware of a way to debug the Lua as it runs the site. If this were not a personal challenge I gave
myself then there's no way I could make a sustainable development cycle. There's a variety of other tools with 
documentation to have a site up and running almost immeadiately.
