	<h1>Gify Pet Page</h1>
</div>
<p>
	Gify Page exist becasue I wanted to have some kind of interactive media on the site while I learn to make this 
	site more interactive, which it will be in the future. Also I found that and the theme through a <a href="https://neocities.org/">GeoCities-like</a>.
	I plan to get rid of it after I have other interactivity on the site.
