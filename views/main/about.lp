        I'm in Boston University, getting a degree in Computer Science. I'm much more intersted in software and programming than actual <i>computer science</i> though.

    <p>I enjoy collecting/playing videogames, playing table-tops, card games really all forms of interactive media.</p>
    <p>My favorite consoles are the GameCube, the Dreamcast, and the Vita. The first two are really nostalgic to me.</p>

        I enjoy digital art. If I know I'll have an extended amount of free time, I like to draw with my Wacom.
        Trying to finish a drawing takes an unholy amount of time for me. I'm sure it will get better with more practice,
        if I ever get the time.

    <p>Also I enjoy cooking and baking but the prep and clean up time are usually too much, so I end up ordering out or heating up food with virtually no clean up.</p>

    <p>I love sci-fi and I'll read/watch/play almost anything of that genre.</p>

        My taste in music has become increasingly obscure. The genre I enjoy most and also code to is <code>Future Funk</code>,
        which is kind of like Japanese House and Disco Music but often with a retro influence. Here's the most popular song.
